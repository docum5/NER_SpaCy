## The Problem
There is more unstructured data in existence today than ever before. According to Forbes, 90% of the worldâ€™s data was generated in the last two years alone, and more data means a need for more brainpower to process that data. The human brain can only take in so much, but technology has allowed us to increase that processing power by using computers as our cognitive processing tool. Today, financial professionals are looking towards artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to help them spend less time on data discovery and more time acting on the insights from data. One of the tools in the AI arsenal is named entity recognition (NER). NER is a machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) service that helps create structure from unstructured textual documents by finding and extracting entities within the document.

***The NER model that is often scattered on the internet is the English NER. Indonesian language NER is rarely developed, especially Indonesian language NER which has specific job specifics such as the legal field. Therefore, for cases like this, like it or not, we have to develop our own NER model.***

I asked to build Name Entity Recognition with custom entities in this project. There are nama lain, jabatan pemohon, organisasi, tanggal_acara, waktu_acara, nomorsurat_terkait.

## Goal
The problem to be solved by this capstone project is how to built a model that can correctly predict custom entities in the Indonesian language and businesses' needs from unstructured OCR-recognized text.

## Project Main Steps:

- Get the dataset
- Made a training dataset for custom entities
- Converting text into Spacy format
- Modeling a text dataset
- Saving and loading a trained model


## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
